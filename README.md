# A Homebrew tap for TractoR

This repository is a simple [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) tap for the [TractoR project](https://github.com/tractor/). It allows TractoR (and R) to be easily installed on systems that already use Homebrew to manage software.

The command

    brew install tractor/tractor/tractor

should be sufficient to install TractoR and R. Standard `brew` subcommands can be used to manage the installation, and to upgrade to newer versions of the package when they are released.
